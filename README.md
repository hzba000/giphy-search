<h1> Thoughts on the Exercise </h1>

<h2> Live App </h2>

<h2> My Process </h2>
<ul>
<li>Write down and draw out pictures of what I think the app should do and start some wireframing</li>
<li>Go back and refresh myself on some react syntax and start creating partial components on paper for the app</li>
<li>Get familiar with the API and see if I can successfully make calls to it, and get data back</li>
<li>Combine the data I get back with some of my basic wireframes to create an MVP</li>
<li>Put myself in the user's shoes and see if I can break the app by typing in weird stuff. I should try my best to look for holes.</li>
<li>Once basic functionality is accomplished, start styling</li>
</ul>

<h2> What would I do if I had more time?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I didn't do as much as I could have on the accessibility front. I could use ARIA for DOM elements and watch color contrast better.</li>
<li>I would add a nicer landing page that explains what the app does more clearly</li>
<li>I would add animations to enhance the user experience a little bit. I think that the animations would add some fun to a very visual app that people look at to have a good time</li>
<li>I would add some more functionality...maybe mash it up with another third party API to create some fun combinations</li>
<li>I would like the ability to click on a gif, and emphasize it in a shadow box</li>
<li>The fonts, color scheme could work together a little better to make it easier to see</li>
<li>It could be nice to have a backend that can process and store user favorites</li>
<li>I noticed in the documentation that there are some custom APIs listed. I could have predictive search. That would improve the user experience</li>
<li>Have people try the app out so that I can iron out the bugs that I know must exist</li>
<li>Practice DRY a little more in my render method</li>
<li>Think of a better way to reduce Big O Complexity when sorting through data from the API</li>
<li>Fix my favicon</li>
<li>I have an idea for a three door monty type app involving gifs that could be fun</li>
<li>If the app became more complex, I could use Redux for state management</li>

</ul>
